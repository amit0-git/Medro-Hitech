## 🏗️ Design & Architecture Choices

### Component-Based Architecture
The application follows a modular component-based architecture where each feature is encapsulated in its own component with:
- **Component folder structure**: Each component lives in its own directory with `.jsx` and `.module.css` files

### Code Splitting & Performance Optimization
- **React Lazy Loading**: Components are loaded on-demand using `React.lazy()` to reduce initial bundle size
